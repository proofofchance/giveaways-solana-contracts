//! # ProofOfChance Giveaways Program
//!
//! A transparent, decentralized giveaway system built on Solana that uses
//! participant-provided entropy (proof-of-chance) for fair winner selection.
//!
//! ## Core Concepts
//!
//! ### Proof-of-Chance Model
//! - Participants provide a secret phrase that gets hashed on-chain
//! - During the upload window, participants use a provider receipt or reveal directly on-chain
//! - Verified reveal digests are aggregated for transparent entropy generation
//! - Winners are selected deterministically using aggregated entropy
//!
//! ### Anti-Censorship Design
//! - Provider receipts may be relayed by any caller and bind the participant wallet
//! - Participants can bypass a refusing/unavailable provider with `AttestReveal`
//! - Provider must include all receipt-attested participants in reveal batches
//! - If any attested participant is missing, settlement is blocked
//!
//! ### Eligibility and Finalization
//! - Creator disqualification is restricted to the pre-settlement review window
//! - Finalization consumes immutable participant indices and is permissionless
//! - The final archival scan emits winners and locks the result atomically
//!
//! ## Account Architecture
//!
//! All accounts use Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for security:
//! - **Config**: `["config"]` - Global system configuration
//! - **Giveaway**: `["giveaway", config_pubkey, giveaway_id_le_bytes]` - Individual giveaway state
//! - **Participant**: `["participant", giveaway_pubkey, wallet_pubkey]` - Participant data
//! - **Vault**: `["vault", giveaway_pubkey]` - Fund custody account
//! - **WinnersLedger**: `["winners_root_v2", giveaway_pubkey]` - Winner settlement data
//! - **FinalizationLedger**: `["finalization_root_v2", giveaway_pubkey]` - Fixed radix state
//!
//! ## Instruction Flow
//!
//! 1. **Initialize**: Set up global configuration (once per deployment)
//! 2. **CreateGiveaway**: Creator sets up giveaway with locked funds
//! 3. **Participate**: Participants submit proof text and proof-of-chance hash
//! 4. **AttestUploaded / AttestReveal**: Include a committed reveal through receipt or direct path
//! 5. **UploadReveals**: Provider uploads receipt-attested reveal batches
//! 6. **DisqualifyParticipant**: Creator can remove invalid entries before settlement
//! 7. **FinalizeWinners**: Run indexed aggregation, radix selection, and archival emission passes
//! 8. **SettlePayoutBatch**: Pay equal-value winners verified against the locked threshold
//!
//! ## Security Features
//!
//! - **PDA-based accounts**: All accounts use program-derived addresses
//! - **Locked funds**: Creator cannot withdraw; funds only go to winners
//! - **Transparent operations**: All actions emit events for audit trail
//! - **Anti-censorship**: Direct reveal and receipt relay paths remove provider liveness control
//! - **Deterministic selection**: Same entropy always produces same winners
